🚀 Unveiling Healthcare Insights with SQL! 🏥📊
Data-driven decision-making is reshaping industries, and healthcare is no exception. Through SQL, I explored a hospital finance dataset to derive meaningful insights that can improve hospital operations and patient care.
🔍 Key analyses included:
 ✅ Total patient count across hospitals 🏥
 ✅ Top 3 departments with the highest patient numbers
 ✅ Hospitals with maximum medical expenses 💰
 ✅ Average length of hospital stays per department
 ✅ Monthly medical expense trends 📅
By leveraging SQL, we can transform raw data into actionable intelligence that enhances resource allocation, cost management, and overall healthcare efficiency. Excited to keep diving deeper into the intersection of finance, healthcare, and data analytics!
Would love to hear your thoughts—how do you see data playing a role in healthcare finance? 🤔
